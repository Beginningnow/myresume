    <h2>PROJECT(INTERN):</h2>
    <P>THEME : Deep Learning Approaches for Covid Diagnosis using Chest CT Scan.</P>
    <P>DESCRIPTION : Deep learning approaches for COVID-19 diagnosis using chest CT scans   involve training artificial neural networks to analyze CT images and detect patterns associated with the disease. These models learn to automatically extract relevant features from the scans and classify them as COVID-19 positive or negative. They leverage large datasets of labeled CT images to optimize their performance. The deep learning models offer the potential for accurate and efficient diagnosis, aiding in the early detection and management of COVID-19 cases. However, their effectiveness relies on high-quality and diverse training data, as well as rigorous validation in real-world clinical settings.</P>
